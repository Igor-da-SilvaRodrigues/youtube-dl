# youtube-dl-download-script
Repo created to store a script to download a video and convert it to youtube with youtube-dl. Doing this because I don't want to re-learn how to use youtube-dl every time I want to download an audio file from youtube.

#### Requirements
- youtube-dl
- ffmpeg

Remember to run in administrator mode to avoid problems.
